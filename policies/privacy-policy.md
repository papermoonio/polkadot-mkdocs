The data will be retained to prove compliance with our legal and/or contractual obligations. We will retain personal information for as long as necessary or permitted by the purposes for which it was obtained. For that purpose, the period of 6 years established in Article 30 of the Code of Commerce will be considered alongside any other applicable retention requirements.

## International Data Transfers

In some cases, the personal data provided by the User may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), mainly to service providers acting as data processors, such as cloud storage providers, analytics platforms, or electronic messaging services.

These international data transfers are carried out based on mechanisms that ensure adequate protection in accordance with the GDPR. Specifically, when necessary, we implement Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission, which ensure that personal data receives an adequate level of protection, regardless of the local legislation of the recipient country.

## Legal Basis for Processing

The legal basis for processing the User’s data is the Company's legitimate interest in carrying out the aforementioned processing, as well as the express consent given by the User when browsing the Website or using the Services or, where applicable, the consent expressly granted by the User when completing any of the forms on the Website or when using the Services. Said consent may be revoked at any time.

## Users’ Rights

Users are entitled to exercise their rights of access to their personal data, request the rectification of inaccurate data, or, where appropriate, request its deletion when, among other reasons, the User considers that the data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected.

In certain circumstances, you may request the restriction of the processing of your data, in which case the Company will only keep it for the exercise or defense of legal actions and claims. In addition, and for reasons related to your particular situation, you may object to processing your data, in which case your information will no longer be processed unless there are legitimate grounds to do so by applicable law.

To exercise such rights, the User may contact the Company at contact@papermoon.io. Likewise, the User may file a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency or with his national control authority on data protection matters, exceptionally when not satisfied with the response to the exercise of rights, in which case the User may access the website www.aepd.es.

## Cookies

Information can be automatically stored on the User's computer or other device when the User visits the Website. This is done in the form of so-called "cookies" or a similar file, which help the Company in various ways, for example, to get to know the preferences of visitors and Users of the Website and to improve the Website and Services. Both permanent and functional/temporary session cookies may be used: permanent cookies remain on your computer after you close your session until you delete them. In contrast, session cookies expire when you close your browser. And for more information about “cookies” generally, please visit [https://allaboutcookies.org/](https://allaboutcookies.org/){target=\_blank}.

## Other Data Privacy Concerns

Although the transmission of information over wireless and wired networks is not 100% secure, and therefore, the security of your information cannot be guaranteed, we employ generally accepted industry standards to protect such information through appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect the personal data provided by Users.

Such measures include encryption during data transfer, restricted access policies, and periodic security audits.

The User may interact with the Company through social media. The information collected by the Company through social networks sometimes includes personal information available online and to the public. We recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies provided by the companies that operate such social networking sites before you start using them to ensure that you are happy with how your personal information is collected and shared.

The Company may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, and we therefore recommend that the User consults it each time he/she accesses the Website. In particular, concerning the Services and to the extent that new versions of the same are offered, this Policy may change, in which case the Company will predispose a new Privacy Policy that complies with the GDPR for acceptance by the User.
